# Malaria-Classification
A Deep learning model that helps in prediction of cells diagnose with Malaria

# Malaria Classification Project

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook project focuses on using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify cells and predict whether they are diagnosed with malaria. Achieving an accuracy of 93%, the model demonstrates its efficacy in automated diagnosis.
